Multiple plugins with the same name 'aksoundengine' (found at 'Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86/Release/AkSoundEngine.dll' and 'Assets/Wwise/Deployment/Plugins/Windows/x86/Profile/AkSoundEngine.dll'). That means one or more plugins are set to be compatible with Editor. Only one plugin at the time can be used by Editor.
